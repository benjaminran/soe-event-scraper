DESCRIPTION:Personal smart devices have become ubiquitous. Millions of inn
 ovative apps run on our tablets\, smart phones\, and smart watches\, bring
 ing these devices to life. Whether the app provides photo sharing\, heart-
 rate monitoring\, collaborative editing\, or even gaming\, managing data l
 ocally on the devices and remotely through various cloud-based services is
  crucial in defining the user experience. In the near future\, the needs o
 f the apps running on tens of billions of networked smart devices will fur
 ther exacerbate the challenges with managing data. Much of the value propo
 sition\, and the burden\, will also rest with the cloud infrastructure to 
 provide quick responses to queries\, personalize and recommend through ana
 lytics\, and allow seamless access to content. To build “data-centric”
  applications spanning the devices and the cloud\, developers need high-le
 vel abstractions for managing data. My talk will focus on the systems infr
 astructure that powers such applications.\nhttps://www.soe.ucsc.edu/events

DESCRIPTION:The browser has evolved from a simple program that displays 
 static web pages to a continuously changing platform that has become our p
 ortal to the Internet.The fierce competition among the browser vendo
 rs has led to a remarkable introduction of features in past few years. Th
 e rapid changes and the high popularity of browsers have attracted at
 tackers\, which pose new threats to the unsuspecting Internet surfers. I
 n this talk\, I will focus on two different attacks related to browser
 s. First\, I will present my work on defenses against drive-by downloads.
  These are attacks that take control of the users' machines by just vi
 siting malicious URLs\, have troubled the research community for years a
 nd are still affecting the users. Then\, I will focus on a new emerging
  threat\, malicious browser extensions. To cope with this new problem I'
 m going to present Hulk\, a dynamic analysis system that detects maliciou
 s behavior in browser extensions by monitoring their execution and corre
 sponding network activity.\nhttps://www.soe.ucsc.edu/events/event/3800
